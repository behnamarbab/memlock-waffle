        select the first entity of the queue, as E

    calibrate the test case
    trim the test cases (if needed)
    calculate the performance score
    bitflip
    interesting values and dictionary usage
    random havoc



calibrate:
    /* Calibrate a new test case. This is done when processing the input directory
   to warn about flaky or otherwise problematic test cases early on; and when
   new paths are discovered to detect variable behavior and so on. */

trimming:
    /* Trim all new test cases to save cycles when doing deterministic checks. The
   trimmer uses power-of-two increments somewhere between 1/16 and 1/1024 of
   file size, to keep the stage short and sweet. */
